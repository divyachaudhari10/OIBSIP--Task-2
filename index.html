            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. 
                Six weeks later the family moved to Munich, where he later on began his schooling
                at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his 
                education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic 
                School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, 
                the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was 
                unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant 
                in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.</p>
